Welcome to Boilerplate NextJS!! :)

This is a [Next.js] (https://nextjs.org/) project started with [`create-next-app`] (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages / create-next-app).

## Technologies Used:

- [TypeScript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [ReactJS] (https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [NextJS] (https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Storybook] (https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)
- [Styled Components] (https://styled-components.com/docs)
- [Plop] (https://plopjs.com/)
- [Dependabot] (https://dependabot.com/)
- [Cypress] (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress)
- [React Testing Library] (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Prettier] (https://prettier.io/docs/en/)
- [ESLint] (https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/)

## Starting
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# ou
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] (http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page automatically refreshes as you edit the file.

[API Routes] (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello] (http://localhost:3000/api/ hello ) This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to ` /api/* `. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes] (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) rather than React pages.
